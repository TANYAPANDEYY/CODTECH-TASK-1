Overview of My Text Summarization Project

Project Title:

Text Summarization Tool Using NLP

Objective:

Develop a Python-based text summarization tool that can process lengthy articles and generate concise summaries using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Requirements:

1. Implement an NLP-based summarization technique to extract key sentences from long texts.


2. Deliverable: A Python script that takes an input text and outputs a concise summary.



Approach:

Use the sumy libraryâ€™s LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) method for extractive text summarization.

Utilize nltk for text tokenization and processing.

Ensure that the script is user-friendly and works with different input texts.


Technologies Used:

Python (Core programming language)

sumy (Text summarization library)

nltk (Natural Language Toolkit for text processing)


Expected Outcome:

A functional Python script that can take any long article or document and generate a concise, meaningful summary while preserving the key information.

Next Steps:

1. Develop & Test the script with different types of text.


2. Optimize the summarization method for accuracy.


3. Document the project and prepare for GitHub submission or final presentation.
